/**
 * Module: `@app/api/v1/cognition/_bundle`
 * Purpose: Pure composition of the session-start kickstart bundle — the
 *   irreducible tooling invariants (code-owned) plus the markdown renderer
 *   that frames hub-delivered skills + domain pointers for a SessionStart hook.
 * Scope: Pure functions + the invariants constant. No I/O, no env, no container.
 * Invariants:
 *   - IRREDUCIBLE_INVARIANTS_ALWAYS_PRESENT: the constant is the one piece of
 *     cognition that must render even when the hub is empty/unreachable.
 *   - ORIENTATION_LOADED_IN_FULL: renders pointers (id + title + recall path)
 *     for skills/domains, but the current-node `<slug>-agent-orientation` entry
 *     is rendered IN FULL — the bootstrap IS the agent's operating map, so the
 *     git skeleton stays minimal and the Dolt orientation carries the substance.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: docs/spec/node-baas-architecture.md
 * @internal
