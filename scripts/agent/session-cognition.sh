#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Session-start cognition loader — shared by the Claude Code (.claude/settings.json)
# and Codex (.codex/config.toml) SessionStart hooks. Presents THIS node's own
# cognition bundle on stdout; both runtimes inject it into context.
#
# Design: LOCAL-FIRST PRESENT + ASYNC REFRESH. The hook fires on every
# startup/resume/compact and on every process respawn — so it must NEVER put a
# live call to the apex hub on the boot path. Acquisition (fetch) and
# presentation (inject) are separate concerns:
#   - presentation reads a durable, gitignored local cache
#     (.cogni/.cognition-cache.md) and is pure-offline, instant, and
#     deterministic;
#   - acquisition is a backgrounded, TTL-gated refresh whose failure is silent,
#     because a stale-but-present bundle always beats a network stall or a scary
#     wall. Once a session has ever oriented, a hub outage is invisible here.
# Only genuine first-boot with no cache surfaces a short, honest notice, and it
# never cries wolf: it separates "no credentials yet" (a setup step) from a
# key-present failure (hub down/slow, or a key without a principal).
#
# Why this matters: this hook runs on every agent session across the whole
# fleet. Coupling boot to a live cognidao.org fetch made the apex a fleet-wide
# SPOF and, worst of all, broke the very tooling meant to warn "prod is down"
# precisely because prod was down (bug.5122 — cognition boot self-dependency).
#
# .env.cogni holds two accounts (see .env.cogni.example): the NODE account
# (this node's own hub — the bearer used here) and the OPERATOR account
# (cognidao.org — CI/CD only: flight, deploy, secrets; never used by this loader).

No COGNI_NODE_API_KEY was found, so this session could not load its cognition
bundle from:
  $URL

This is a setup step, not an outage. To bootstrap:
- register a NODE agent via /api/v1/agent/register
- save COGNI_NODE_API_KEY in the clone-root .env.cogni
- for Codex, review and trust the repo's SessionStart hook via /hooks

Then restart or resume the agent. (Once it loads once, it is cached locally and
survives hub outages.)

COGNI COGNITION — could not load bundle (first boot, no cache)

A credential IS present, so this is NOT a missing-key setup problem. Either the
hub is down/slow, or the key lacks a principal on this hub (or the node has no
cognition published yet). There's no local cache to fall back on this first time.

Check hub health (cognidao.org/version) and that GET /api/v1/cognition resolves
with your key. Proceed with the repo's own AGENTS.md + skills meanwhile —
cognition caches itself once it loads, and then survives hub outages.
